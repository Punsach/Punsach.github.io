iOS App written in Swift that allows users to search for movies. The app uses the TMDb API to fetch the data asynchronously. 
The user can save favorite movies and access the favorite movies at any time. Additionally, the user can select a movie to 
view more information fetched from the API. 

Additional features include the ability to view movies by genre, so the user can find a movie based on what genre they are 
interested in. If they find a movie they like, they can automatically access the IMDb page for that movie. On top of that,
they can see where the movie can be streamed on the website Can I Stream It.
