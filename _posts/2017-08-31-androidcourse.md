During the summer, I was on campus working for Student Technology Services as a technician. I had a bit of spare time on me, so I decided to pick up a project with a professor. I approached a professor who I had been both a student and TA for and asked him if he had any projects he was looking to get students for. He told me that he had been thinking about putting together an Android App Development Course since WashU only offered an iOS app development course at the time. He brought me on to work on putting things together. 

At this point, I had no experience with Android App Development, but I was eager to learn. So, I got to researching and programming and after a few weeks I felt I had a good handle of the skills. The real challenge was what came next, however. I met with my Professor and we began to discuss what sort of assignments and material we should put together for students. This was the tricky part. 

In the past, coming up with personal projects for myself was fairly straightforward. I had an idea, either something that was relevant to me in my life, or something I felt could be improved upon, and I started coding it. There were no strict guidelines, I just coded for fun and to create something cool. The difference here was that whatever idea I came up with for a project would be something that all the students in the class would be expected to code. This meant we had to keep certain things in mind. 

When creating an assignment for a student to code, you have to consider many things. For one, the assignment needs to be reasonable. The student should be able to complete the assignment within a couple weeks. This is also incorporating the fact that the student is new to Android App Development in general, and so will need time at first to get comfortable. Additionally, the assignment needs to incorporate certain core concepts that are important to Android App Development. This means that whatever you ask them to build, and however you ask them to build it, it needs to make sense. There is also the issues of TAs. The assignments need to be friendly for the TAs to be able to effectively help debug code and help the students understand what is going on. These things all presented a unique challenge to me. 

From this point, I set to work. I started brainstorming ideas of projects that were reasonable for students and TAs, and were super fun. One assignment was to code a Blackjack game where the students could play games of Blackjack with a dealer. After prototyping the assignment, we were confident it would work. From here, I wanted to come up with an assignment that would make use of a REST API so students could get comfortable with that. I ended up finding a Pokemon API online that returns Pokemon data for every possible Pokemon you could think. So, my professor and I decided to build a Pokemon battle simulator. This one was a really fun project, and probably my crowning achievement of this experience. 

I think the main takeaway from this experience for me was the new outlook as a developer. I had to adopt a new mindset towards coming up with ideas for my projects as well as how I wrote my code. In essence, my "client" was unique in the sense that it was a student body who will have no exposure to Android App Development. I really enjoyed the experience, and I am very excited to go TA for it when it is offered in Fall 2018.
