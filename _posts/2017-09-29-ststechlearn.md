ReactJS Site that allows technicians to test themselves on material related to different concepts related to technical support and customer service. 

![Training Site Image](/img/ststechlearn.png)

The site was built entirely in JavaScript using the ReactJS framework for the front end and ExpressJS for the backend. The app allows users to look through different types of material related to the technical support provided by Student Technology Services at Washington University in St. Louis. 

The site also allows users to track their progress as they go through the different sections of material. Additionally, the administrative staff are able to track the progress of all the technicians to make sure they are up to date on the testing. 

Possible future functionalities: some sort of analytics to track the progress of all technicians and see which sections they are doing the worst/best on.
