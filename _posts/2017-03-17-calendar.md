Asynchronous JavaScript calendar that supports a month by month view and allows users to add, edit, delete, and share events. 

![Calendar Image](/img/calendarOne.png)

The calendar uses asynchronous calls with PHP server side scripts to access data such as events and users which stored using MySQL. 

Days with events will indicate how many events are on that day, and when the user clicks on the day it will display a list of events on that day. The user can edit, delete, or share these events with other users. 

The user is also given the option of tagging events as important, and filtering the calendar display by these important events.
