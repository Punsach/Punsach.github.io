Laravel Site that allows users to practice a variety of math questions and improve their skills.  

![Practice Site Image](/img/mathSiteOne.png)

The site was built using PHP Laravel, with MySQL as the database. The Eloquent ORM was used to handle user authentication and account management.

Once a user logs in, they see a profile page with their current status. The user can select to answer math questions and test
their skills. The questions are organized by difficulty, and more difficult questions receive more points. The user can 
either generate questions randomly, or get a random question of a specific difficulty. 

The site also supports a leaderboard functionality, where the user can see who is ranked on the board by points. 

Possible future functionalities: user can submit their own questions to be displayed on the site.
