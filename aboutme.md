---

My name is Puneet Sachdeva. I am currently a Computer Science major at Washington University in St. Louis. Through middle and high school I participated in many math competitions and discovered a love for problem solving. Eventually, I took my first Computer Science course in my sophomore year of high school. Since then, I have worked towards combining my ability to solve problems with skills in programming. Currently, I am working as a Student Technician at Student Technology Services and provide technical support to students and faculty at Washington University. I am also a Grader and Course Assistant for Introduction and Intermediate Python courses offered by Art of Problem Solving, an mathematics based education company. In the fall I will be a Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Computer Science, Data Structures and Algorithms, and a seminar for coding interview preparation. In my free time, I am a Captain of the Bhangra team at my university and a volunteer at the local Stray Rescue Animal Shelter. 

**Currently, I have been working on variety of coding projects in my spare time. I am working with a professor at the University to design an Android App Development course to offer in Fall 2018. I have prototyped multiple assignments for this upcoming course.** 

**Additionally, I am building a training app for Student Technology Services using ReactJS, which will be used to train the staff who will be working during the school year.**
