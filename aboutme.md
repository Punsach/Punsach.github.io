My name is Puneet Sachdeva. I am currently a Computer Science major at Washington University in St. Louis. Through middle and high school I participated in many math competitions and discovered a love for problem solving. Then I took my first Computer Science course in my sophomore year of high school. Since then, I have worked towards combining my ability to solve problems and my ability to generate code. Currently, I am working as a Student Technician at Student Technology Services for my campus and providing technical support to students and faculty. I am also a Grader and Course Assistant for Introduction and Intermediate Python courses offered by Art of Problem Solving, an mathematics based education company. In the fall I will be a Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Computer Science, Data Structures and Algorithms, and a seminar for coding interview preparation. In my free time, I am a Captain of the Bhangra team at my university and a volunteer at the local Stray Rescue Animal Shelter.
