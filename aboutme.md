title: Who am I? 
subtitle: I am a Dancer, Teacher, Technician, and an aspiring Software Developer
---

My name is Puneet Sachdeva. I am currently a Computer Science major at Washington University in St. Louis. Through middle and high school I participated in math competitions and discovered a love for problem solving. Eventually, I took my first Computer Science course in my sophomore year of high school. Since then, I have worked towards combining my ability to solve problems with skills in programming. Currently, I am working as a Student Technician at Student Technology Services and provide technical support to students and faculty at Washington University. I am also a Grader and Course Assistant for Introduction and Intermediate Python courses offered by Art of Problem Solving, a mathematics based education company. In the fall I will be a Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Computer Science, Data Structures and Algorithms, and a seminar for coding interview preparation. In my free time, I am a Captain of the Bhangra team at my university and a volunteer at the local Stray Rescue Animal Shelter. 

**Currently, I am working as the Head Teaching Assistant of the Data Structures and Algorithms class at my university and am working on improving the material for the course. Additionally, I am working as an instructor for a seminar that prepares students for coding interviews.**

**Additionally, I work as a student developer for DevSTAC, a group of students that work on building applications for organizations on campus. I am in the process of creating a React.js training program to prepare student developers to use the technology for our projects.**

**This summer, I will be working as a Software Engineering Intern at TripAdvisor in Needham, MA. I will work in Full Stack Web Development, and am very excited!**
